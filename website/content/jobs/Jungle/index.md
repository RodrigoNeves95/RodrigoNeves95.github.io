- Had the opportunity to do my master thesis work in a professional environment. The main research goal was to study, implement
and test the performance of different deep learning models and architectures applied to time-series problems, specifically on the
area of predictive maintenance and forecasting. This allowed me to be an active member of Jungleâ€™s daily projects to establish their
technology.
