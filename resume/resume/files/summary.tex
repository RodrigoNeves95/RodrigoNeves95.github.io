\begin{cvparagraph}
Currently working as a contractor to a consultant company as a Machine Learning engineer, with previous experience (4 years) working as a Software/Machine Learning engineer at a start-up with a focus on building predictive solutions for the energy and industry sector. Started working on a pure data scientist position, but steady and slowly started to earn more responsibility and work in different positions and tasks like developing production-ready software, designing and building internal and
  external dashboards, presenting solutions to clients, deploying and managing workflows over a Kubernetes cluster and working on the frontend and backend of the core product. That led me to learn skills from different fields like machine learning, software and full-stack engineering. This exposure to many areas of the software cycle allows me to understand how they interact and impact each other, which I consider really important in a fast-paced environment like it is the software field
  nowadays. Nevertheless, I still have a lot to learn and it seems that every day there is something new to learn which is both exciting and terrifying. Above positions and/or titles what I love most about my daily work is to feel challenged and uncomfortable. I consider myself as someone who is eager to learn, loves a good challenge, likes to ask questions, do not like inefficiencies, aims for excellence and is always ready to help.
