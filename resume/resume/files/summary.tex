Currently working as a contractor to a consultant company as a Machine Learning engineer consultant, with previous experience (4 years) working as a Software/Machine Learning engineer at a start-up with a focus on building predictive solutions for the energy and industry sector. Started working on a pure data scientist position, but steady and slowly started to earn more responsibility and work in different positions and tasks like developing production-ready software, designing and building internal and external dashboards, developing and building CI/CD pipelines to automate several tasks, pushing MLOps good practices, deploying and managing workflows over a Kubernetes cluster and working on the frontend and backend of the core product. That led me to learn skills from different fields like machine learning, software, and full-stack engineering. This exposure to many areas of the software cycle allows me to understand how they interact and impact each other, which I consider really important in a fast-paced environment like it is the software field nowadays. Nevertheless, I know that I still have a lot to learn and every day it seems that I know even less than the day before. The development pace of new technologies, frameworks, and tools can be daunting and terrifying, but you will have to face it as new opportunities and excitement. Above positions and/or titles what I love most about my daily work is to feel challenged and uncomfortable. I consider myself as someone who is eager to learn, loves a good challenge, likes to ask questions, does not like inefficiencies, aims for excellence, and is always ready to help.
